<doc f='Modules/System/Inc/System/tChunk.h' l='73'>// Use this if you want this class to write to memory instead of a file. To compute the size of the buffer you&apos;ll
	// need, use this to be conservative:
	// numBytesNeeded = (numChunks * 8) + SumOverAllChunks(chunkDataSize + chunkAlignmentSize).
	// Also note that if you want the written data aligned you&apos;ll need to supply an aligned dst pointer. Choose a value
	// that is the maximum of your alignment requirements for all chunks you will be writing. Supplying a buffer that
	// is 512 byte aligned is guaranteed to work in all cases.</doc>
