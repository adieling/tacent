	 * @brief The amount of overshoot needed to early-out refinement.
	 *
	 * The codec will refine block candidates iteratively to improve the encoding, based on the
	 * @c tune_refinement_limit count. Earlier implementations will use all refinement iterations,
	 * even if the target threshold is reached. This tuning parameter allows an early out, but with
	 * an overshoot MSE threshold. Setting this to 1.0 will early-out as soon as the target is hit,
	 * but does reduce image quality vs the default behavior of over-refinement.
