// of memory pools without adding complexity to the implementation of new. The overloaded new can just call Malloc. The

	//
	// Static initialization guarantees Constructed is false. Any Malloc calls before construction will return nullptr
	// allowing us to fall back to std malloc. In the allocator destructor we can set Constructed to false but do not
	// free the allocator memory unless NumAllocations == 0. Any other allocator free calls can now check if Constructed
	// is false and free the allocator memory if NumAllocations is 0.
	//
	// The other option is to simply not use custom allocators before main at all. You could add initialize and shutdown
	// calls at the beginning and end of main. Even then, something like a static tString would initialize using
	// non-allocator memory, but could be reassigned during main (using allocator memory), so we'd still need to keep
