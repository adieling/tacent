The dds and ktx2 images were generated from NVidia texture Tools Exporter.
The ASTC versions do not seem to have written the alpha channel properly, while the BC7 ones were written.
At least when dragging them back into the NVTT exporter, only the BC7 ones show the correct alpha channel.

dds files starting with 'Legacy' do not contain the D.X.1.0. FourCC header.
