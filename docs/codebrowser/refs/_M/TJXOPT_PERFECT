 * This option will cause #tjTransform() to return an error if the transform is
 * not perfect.  Lossless transforms operate on MCU blocks, whose size depends
 * on the level of chrominance subsampling used (see #tjMCUWidth
 * and #tjMCUHeight.)  If the image&apos;s width or height is not evenly divisible
 * by the MCU block size, then there will be partial MCU blocks on the right
 * and/or bottom edges.  It is not possible to move these partial MCU blocks to
 * the top or left of the image, so any transform that would require that is
 * &quot;imperfect.&quot;  If this option is not specified, then any partial MCU blocks
 * that cannot be transformed will be left in place, which will create
 * odd-looking strips on the right or bottom edge of the image.
