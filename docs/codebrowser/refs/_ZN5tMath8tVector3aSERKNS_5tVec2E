<doc f='Modules/Math/Inc/Math/tVector3.h' l='68'>// Friend is used for commutative binary operators where one of the operators is a built-in type. This essentially
	// puts these operators outside of the class where they belong. If the other operand type is user-defined, the
	// operator should be completely outside as there would be ambiguity as to which one owned the friend declaration.</doc>
