<doc f='Modules/Image/Inc/Image/tPicture.h' l='260'>// Adjust brightness based on the tPicture pixels and write them into the adjustment pixel buffer. Brightness is in
	// [0.0,1.0]. When brightness at 0.0 adjustment buffer will be completely black. When brightness at 1.0, pure white,
	// Note that the range of the brigtness is computed so that all values between [0,1] have an effect on the image.
	// This is possible because the min and max colour values were computed by inspecting every pixel when begin was
	// called. In other words the values the colours move up or down for a particular brightness are image dependent,
	// Returns success.
	//
	// The AdjustGetDefaultNNN functions get the parameters needed to have zero affect on the image. For brightness in
	// particular it is dependent on the image contents and may not be exactly 0.5. If the min/max colour values did not
	// reach 0 and full, the default brightness may be offset from 0.5.</doc>
