 * Attributes to be found in stx_attributes and masked in stx_attributes_mask.
 *
 * These give information about the features or the state of a file that might
 * be of use to ordinary userspace programs such as GUIs or ls rather than
 * specialised tools.
 *
 * Note that the flags marked [I] correspond to the FS_IOC_SETFLAGS flags
 * semantically.  Where possible, the numerical value is picked to correspond
 * also.  Note that the DAX attribute indicates that the file is in the CPU
 * direct access state.  It does not correspond to the per-inode flag that
 * some filesystems support.
