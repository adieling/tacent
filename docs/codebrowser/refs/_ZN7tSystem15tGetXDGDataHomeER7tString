<doc f='Modules/System/Inc/System/tMachine.h' l='43'>// These functions return the XDG environment variables in the first argument. They also respect all default values as
// specified by https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/. True is returned if the envirenment
// variable was set. False is returned if the env var was unset and the default had to be used. The paths are returned
// in Tacent&apos;s path format with trailing / for directories. All paths are absolute as defined by the spec. Clients using
// these functions should NOT place data directly in the returned directories -- they should make a subdirectory,
// usually the name of the app in lowercase, and put their files there.</doc>
