ICO image loading code based on ico.cpp

The tImageICO class knows how to load windows icon (ico) files. It loads the data into multiple tPixel arrays, one for
each part (ico files may be multiple images at different resolutions). The loading code is a modificaton of code from
Victor Laskin. In particular the code now:
a) Loads all parts of an ico, not just the biggest one.
b) Supports embedded png images.
c) Supports widths and heights of 256.
Victor Laskin's header/licence in the original ico.cpp is shown below.
