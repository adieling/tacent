 * The size of the buffer (in bytes) required to hold a YUV image plane with
 * the given parameters.
 *
 * @param componentID ID number of the image plane (0 = Y, 1 = U/Cb, 2 = V/Cr)
 *
 * @param width width (in pixels) of the YUV image.  NOTE: this is the width of
 * the whole image, not the plane width.
 *
 * @param stride bytes per line in the image plane.  Setting this to 0 is the
 * equivalent of setting it to the plane width.
 *
 * @param height height (in pixels) of the YUV image.  NOTE: this is the height
 * of the whole image, not the plane height.
 *
 * @param subsamp level of chrominance subsampling in the image (see
 * @ref TJSAMP &quot;Chrominance subsampling options&quot;.)
 *
 * @return the size of the buffer (in bytes) required to hold the YUV image
 * plane, or -1 if the arguments are out of bounds.
