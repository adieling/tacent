<doc f='Modules/Image/Contrib/TinyXML2/tinyxml2.h' l='1520'>/** Convenience function for easy access to the text inside an element. Although easy
    	and concise, GetText() is limited compared to getting the XMLText child
    	and accessing it directly.

    	If the first child of &apos;this&apos; is a XMLText, the GetText()
    	returns the character string of the Text node, else null is returned.

    	This is a convenient method for getting the text of simple contained text:
    	@verbatim
    	&lt;foo&gt;This is text&lt;/foo&gt;
    		const char* str = fooElement-&gt;GetText();
    	@endverbatim

    	&apos;str&apos; will be a pointer to &quot;This is text&quot;.

    	Note that this function can be misleading. If the element foo was created from
    	this XML:
    	@verbatim
    		&lt;foo&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is text&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/foo&gt;
    	@endverbatim

    	then the value of str would be null. The first child node isn&apos;t a text node, it is
    	another element. From this XML:
    	@verbatim
    		&lt;foo&gt;This is &lt;b&gt;text&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/foo&gt;
    	@endverbatim
    	GetText() will return &quot;This is &quot;.
