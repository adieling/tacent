 * Encode an RGB or grayscale image into a YUV planar image.  This function
 * uses the accelerated color conversion routines in the underlying
 * codec but does not execute any of the other steps in the JPEG compression
 * process.
 *
 * @param handle a handle to a TurboJPEG compressor or transformer instance
 *
 * @param srcBuf pointer to an image buffer containing RGB or grayscale pixels
 * to be encoded
 *
 * @param width width (in pixels) of the source image
 *
 * @param pitch bytes per line in the source image.  Normally, this should be
 * &lt;tt&gt;width * #tjPixelSize[pixelFormat]&lt;/tt&gt; if the image is unpadded, or
 * &lt;tt&gt;#TJPAD(width * #tjPixelSize[pixelFormat])&lt;/tt&gt; if each line of the image
 * is padded to the nearest 32-bit boundary, as is the case for Windows
 * bitmaps.  You can also be clever and use this parameter to skip lines, etc.
 * Setting this parameter to 0 is the equivalent of setting it to
 * &lt;tt&gt;width * #tjPixelSize[pixelFormat]&lt;/tt&gt;.
 *
 * @param height height (in pixels) of the source image
 *
 * @param pixelFormat pixel format of the source image (see @ref TJPF
 * &quot;Pixel formats&quot;.)
 *
 * @param dstBuf pointer to an image buffer that will receive the YUV image.
 * Use #tjBufSizeYUV2() to determine the appropriate size for this buffer based
 * on the image width, height, padding, and level of chrominance subsampling.
 * The Y, U (Cb), and V (Cr) image planes will be stored sequentially in the
 * buffer (refer to @ref YUVnotes &quot;YUV Image Format Notes&quot;.)
 *
 * @param pad the width of each line in each plane of the YUV image will be
 * padded to the nearest multiple of this number of bytes (must be a power of
 * 2.)  To generate images suitable for X Video, &lt;tt&gt;pad&lt;/tt&gt; should be set to
 * 4.
 *
 * @param subsamp the level of chrominance subsampling to be used when
 * generating the YUV image (see @ref TJSAMP
 * &quot;Chrominance subsampling options&quot;.)  To generate images suitable for X
 * Video, &lt;tt&gt;subsamp&lt;/tt&gt; should be set to @ref TJSAMP_420.  This produces an
 * image compatible with the I420 (AKA &quot;YUV420P&quot;) format.
 *
 * @param flags the bitwise OR of one or more of the @ref TJFLAG_ACCURATEDCT
 * &quot;flags&quot;
 *
 * @return 0 if successful, or -1 if an error occurred (see #tjGetErrorStr2()
 * and #tjGetErrorCode().)
