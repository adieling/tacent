This is the MIT licence from https://github.com/powervr-graphics/Native_SDK
as of Dec 20, 2023. The code that is leveraged is the PVRTC1 (4bpp and 2bpp)
decode implementation found in PVRTDecompress.h and PVRTDecompress.cpp.
The decode for PVRTC2 is closed source. Imagination does provide PVRTexLib.dll
(from PVRTexTool) but:
a) It is nearly the same size as the Tacent suite of libs compiled as release
   static. The PVRTexLib includes a lot of features that are not needed like
   code to load various other images types in addition to pvr.
b) Is is under a custom license found at
   https://developer.imaginationtech.com/terms/powervr-tools-software-eula/
There are currently no open-source CPU decode implementations for:
PVRTC2 LDR 4bpp 2bpp
PVRTC1 HDR 8bpp 6bpp
PVRTC2 HDR 8bpp 6bpp
