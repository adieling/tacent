	 * @brief The amount of overshoot needed to early-out mode 0 fast path.
	 *
	 * We have a fast-path for mode 0 (1 partition, 1 plane) which uses only essential block modes
	 * as an initial search. This can short-cut compression for simple blocks, but to avoid
	 * short-cutting too much we force this to overshoot the MSE threshold needed to hit the
	 * block-local db_limit e.g. 1.0 = no overshoot, 2.0 = need half the error to trigger.
