   * 4:1:1 chrominance subsampling.  The JPEG or YUV image will contain one
   * chrominance component for every 4x1 block of pixels in the source image.
   * JPEG images compressed with 4:1:1 subsampling will be almost exactly the
   * same size as those compressed with 4:2:0 subsampling, and in the
   * aggregate, both subsampling methods produce approximately the same
   * perceptual quality.  However, 4:1:1 is better able to reproduce sharp
   * horizontal features.
   *
   * @note 4:1:1 subsampling is not fully accelerated in libjpeg-turbo.
