   * CMYK pixel format.  Unlike RGB, which is an additive color model used
   * primarily for display, CMYK (Cyan/Magenta/Yellow/Key) is a subtractive
   * color model used primarily for printing.  In the CMYK color model, the
   * value of each color component typically corresponds to an amount of cyan,
   * magenta, yellow, or black ink that is applied to a white background.  In
   * order to convert between CMYK and RGB, it is necessary to use a color
   * management system (CMS.)  A CMS will attempt to map colors within the
   * printer&apos;s gamut to perceptually similar colors in the display&apos;s gamut and
   * vice versa, but the mapping is typically not 1:1 or reversible, nor can it
   * be defined with a simple formula.  Thus, such a conversion is out of scope
   * for a codec library.  However, the TurboJPEG API allows for compressing
   * CMYK pixels into a YCCK JPEG image (see #TJCS_YCCK) and decompressing YCCK
   * JPEG images into CMYK pixels.
