<doc f='Modules/Foundation/Inc/Foundation/tFundamentals.h' l='161'>// The following Abs function deserves a little explanation. Some linear algebra texts use the term absolute value and
// norm interchangeably. Others suggest that the absolute value of a matrix is the matrix with each component
// being the absolute value of the original. This is what the following template function returns -- not the L2 norm
