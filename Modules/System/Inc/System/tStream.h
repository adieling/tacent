// tStream.h
//
// A stream is an abstract base class that specifies a consistent and simple API for input and output. For example, if
// a tool needs to write files to disk, or memory, or possibly a custom file system, it makes sense to use the tStream
// API since it abstracts away the underlying device. Essentially a stream is any object that can have bytes written
// to, or read from. All streams support the idea of a current read/write index, along with read and write functions.
