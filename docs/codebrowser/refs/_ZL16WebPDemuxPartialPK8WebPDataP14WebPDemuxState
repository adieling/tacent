<doc f='Modules/Image/Contrib/WebP/include/demux.h' l='98'>// Parses the possibly incomplete WebP file given by &apos;data&apos;.
// If &apos;state&apos; is non-NULL it will be set to indicate the status of the demuxer.
// Returns NULL in case of error or if there isn&apos;t enough data to start parsing;
// and a WebPDemuxer object on successful parse.
// Note that WebPDemuxer keeps internal pointers to &apos;data&apos; memory segment.
// If this data is volatile, the demuxer object should be deleted (by calling
// WebPDemuxDelete()) and WebPDemuxPartial() called again on the new data.
// This is usually an inexpensive operation.</doc>
