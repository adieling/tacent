The TinyEXIF licence on the github homepage (from the README.md as of May 24, 2022) is:

The licence in the source code is a bit odd as it says all rights reserved and then immediately proceeds to NOT reserve all rights by granting redistribution rights. I believe this was a holdover from easyexif, tthe original code TinyEXIF is based on. It has the same contradiction. I am including both licences here for completeness. This file is distributed outside of source files as part of binary distributions to comply with the conditions.
