 * @brief Create a self-decompression context.
 *
 * This mode configures the compressor so that it is only guaranteed to be able to decompress images
 * that were actually created using the current context. This is the common case for compression use
 * cases, and setting this flag enables additional optimizations, but does mean that the context
 * cannot reliably decompress arbitrary ASTC images.
