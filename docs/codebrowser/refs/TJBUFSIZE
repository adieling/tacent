 * The maximum size of the buffer (in bytes) required to hold a JPEG image with
 * the given parameters.  The number of bytes returned by this function is
 * larger than the size of the uncompressed source image.  The reason for this
 * is that the JPEG format uses 16-bit coefficients, and it is thus possible
 * for a very high-quality JPEG image with very high-frequency content to
 * expand rather than compress when converted to the JPEG format.  Such images
 * represent a very rare corner case, but since there is no way to predict the
 * size of a JPEG image prior to compression, the corner case has to be
 * handled.
 *
 * @param width width (in pixels) of the image
 *
 * @param height height (in pixels) of the image
 *
 * @param jpegSubsamp the level of chrominance subsampling to be used when
 * generating the JPEG image (see @ref TJSAMP
 * &quot;Chrominance subsampling options&quot;.)
 *
 * @return the maximum size of the buffer (in bytes) required to hold the
 * image, or -1 if the arguments are out of bounds.
