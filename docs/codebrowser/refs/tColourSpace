<doc f='Modules/Math/Inc/Math/tColour.h' l='40'>// Generally floating point colour representations are considered to be in linear colour-space. Linear is where you
// want to do all the work. sRGB (gamma corrected) is probably the space of most textures, especially diffuse textures
// as they were authored on monitors that had a non-linear (gamma) response. Use this enum to indicate
// the colour-space of pixel data you have... if you know it. Unfortunatly you can&apos;t in general determine the space
// from, say, the pixel format -- a non sRGB format may contain sRGB data (but an sRGB format should be assumed to
// actually contain sRGB data). In the below enumerants:
// l = linear
// g = gamma
// q = square
// s = standard
// See tColourProfile for an enum that describes which spaces are used for which channels, and whether they are LDR or
// HDR, in image files.</doc>
