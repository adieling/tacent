   * YCCK colorspace.  YCCK (AKA &quot;YCbCrK&quot;) is not an absolute colorspace but
   * rather a mathematical transformation of CMYK designed solely for storage
   * and transmission.  It is to CMYK as YCbCr is to RGB.  CMYK pixels can be
   * reversibly transformed into YCCK, and as with YCbCr, the chrominance
   * components in the YCCK pixels can be subsampled without incurring major
   * perceptual loss.  YCCK JPEG images can only be compressed from and
   * decompressed to CMYK pixels.
