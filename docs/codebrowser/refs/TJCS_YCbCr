   * YCbCr colorspace.  YCbCr is not an absolute colorspace but rather a
   * mathematical transformation of RGB designed solely for storage and
   * transmission.  YCbCr images must be converted to RGB before they can
   * actually be displayed.  In the YCbCr colorspace, the Y (luminance)
   * component represents the black &amp; white portion of the original image, and
   * the Cb and Cr (chrominance) components represent the color portion of the
   * original image.  Originally, the analog equivalent of this transformation
   * allowed the same signal to drive both black &amp; white and color televisions,
   * but JPEG images use YCbCr primarily because it allows the color data to be
   * optionally subsampled for the purposes of reducing bandwidth or disk
   * space.  YCbCr is the most common JPEG colorspace, and YCbCr JPEG images
   * can be compressed from and decompressed to any of the extended RGB pixel
   * formats or grayscale, or they can be decompressed to YUV planar images.
