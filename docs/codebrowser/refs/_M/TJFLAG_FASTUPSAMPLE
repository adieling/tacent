 * When decompressing an image that was compressed using chrominance
 * subsampling, use the fastest chrominance upsampling algorithm available in
 * the underlying codec.  The default is to use smooth upsampling, which
 * creates a smooth transition between neighboring chrominance components in
 * order to reduce upsampling artifacts in the decompressed image.
