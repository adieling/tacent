# Tacent
Tacent is collection of C++ source files designed to be the basis for a game engine or other interactive project. It is released under the permissive MIT-style ISC licence. Originally the code was the backbone of the Tactile 3D project. 

Selective improvements to take advantage of C++17 features have been made. Modern CMake (target-based) is used to generate the build files. Generators for makefiles, ninja, NMake, and Visual Studio solutions have been tested.

__Browse the Source__

The source files can be browsed using Woboq -- a Clang-based tool that marks-up C++ to web-ready HTML. This tool is being used under the ShareAlike Licence.

### Overview

Tacent is divided into a number of separate packages called modules. Each module is a collection of related source files. Some modules depend on others.

* __Foundation__
The base set of classes, functions, and types. Includes container types (lists, arrays, priority queues, ring buffers), a fast memory pool, big integer types, bitfields, units, a string class. Depends on nothing but platform libs.

* __Math__
Vectors, matrices, quaternions, projections, linear algebra, hash functions, random number generation, splines, analytic functions, geometric primitives, mathematical constants, and colour space conversions. Depends on Foundation.

* __System__
File IO, path and file string parsing functions, chunk-based binary format, configuration file parsing, a light task system, a timer class, formatted printing, regular expression parser, a command-line parser with proper separation of concerns, and other utility functions. Depends on Foundation and Math.

* __Image__
Image loading, saving, manipulation, mipmapping, texture generation. Depends on Foundation, Math, and System.

* __Pipeline__
Process launching with captured output and exit codes, dependency rule checking. Depends on Foundation, Math, and System.

* __Scene__
A scene library that can contain cameras, materials, models, splines, skeletons, lights, materials, attributes, and LOD groups. This is not really a full-on scene graph, but rather a tool to allow an exporter to be built and a geometry pipeline to process exported files. Depends on Foundation, Math, and System.


### Design

Tacent source code should be mostly self-documenting. Some C++ interfaces use obscure language features to control the valid ways in which the objects and functions can be used, but the cost is high â€” these interfaces cannot easily be inspected for intended use. In Tacent the goal has been to make the headers easily human-readable.

The implementations in Tacent are intended to be both clean (easily understood) and efficient. Efficient code does not need to be obscure code. Comments in plain English elucidate the complex parts. However, the reader is expected to know the language, so saying a variable is 'const' in a comment is clearly redundant if the const keyword is being used. There is no 'comment litter' in this regard.

This lack of redundancy and clutter just makes it all easier to absorb. You will notice in headers, for example, that a function argument declared as a tList<Item> will not have a dummy variable called 'items' afterwards, as the type already infers it's a list of items.

The dependencies are reasonable and well-understood. The code should be easy to port to a different environment for this reason. For example, if you need a printf function that supports custom types beyond floats, ints, and strings, as well as supporting different output channels, go ahead and take the tPrintf.h and tPrintf.cpp files in the System module and adapt them to your environment and needs. The dependencies on Tacent types and framework are not overbearing.


### Examples

The easiest way to see how to use the different modules is to look in the unit tests. There may be more information in the comments [on the homepage](http://upperboundsinteractive.com/tacent.php). For example, this is how you'd load a png file and save it to a targa. If the png has transparency, so will the tga:

```C++
tPicture pngPic("ThoseEyes.png");
pngPic.Save("ThoseEyes.tga");
```

And loading a cubemap direct draw surface and saving it to a binary chunk format is done like this:

```C++
tTexture cubemap("Cubemap.dds");
tChunkWriter writer("Cubemap.tac");
cubemap.Save(writer);
```

The image module uses a few third party libraries, all with non-restrictive licences. CxImage (zlib licence) is used to load some formats like png. Gif and ico loading originated from elsewhere as well. Tga and dds are native. Since I wanted the downloadable source to just work, these libraries are included in the repo and have been been upgraded to C++17. The Tacent UnitTests solution will build all dependent libraries.

Regarding the command line parsing code, a powerful feature is separation of concerns. In a typical system the knowledge of all the different command line parameters and options is needed in a single place, often in main() where argc and argv are passed in. These values need to somehow be passed all over the place in a large system. With tCommand you specify which options and parameters you care about only in the cpp file you are working in. A command line in Tacent takes the form:

```
program.exe [arg1 arg2 arg3 ...]
```

Arguments are separated by spaces. An argument must be enclosed in quotes (single or double) if it has a space in it. Use escape sequences to put either type of quote inside. If you need to specify paths, I suggest using forward slashes, although backslashes will work so long as the filename does not have a single or double quote next. An argument may be an 'option' or 'parameter'.

An option is a combination of a 'flag' specified using a single or double hyphen, and zero or more option arguments. A parameter is just a single string. For example:

```
mycopy.exe -R --overwrite fileA.txt -pat fileB.txt --log log.txt
```

The fileA.txt and fileB.txt in the above example are parameters (assuming overwrite does not take any option arguments). The order in which parameters are specified is important. fileA.txt is the first parameter, and fileB.txt is the second. Options on the other hand can be specified in any order. All options take a specific number (zero or more) of option arguments. If an option takes zero arguments it is boolean -- you can only test for its presence (or lack of).

The '--log log.txt' is an option with a single option argument, log.txt. Single character flags specified with a single hyphen may be combined. The -pat in the example expands to -p -a -t. This works well for boolean flags but if there are option arguments only the last flag would get them.

Variable argument counts are not supported for options (so they don't get confused with regular arguments), but you may list the same option more than once. Eg. -i filea.txt -i fileb.txt etc is fine. Alternatively just use non-option arguments. To use the command line class, you start by registering your options and parameters. This is done using the tOption and tParam types to create static objects. After main calls the parse function, your objects get populated appropriately. Here's an example:

```C++
// FileA.cpp:
tParam FromFile(1, "FromFile");             // The 1 means this is the first parameter. The description is optional.
tParam ToFile(2, "ToFile");                 // The 2 means this is the second parameter. The description is optional.
tOption("log", 'l', 1, "Specify log file"); // The 1 means there is one option argument to --log or -l.

// FileB.cpp:
tOption ProgramOption('p', 0, "Program mode.");
tOption AllOption('a', "ALL", 0, "Include all widgets.");
tOption TimeOption("time", 't', 0, "Print timestamp.");

// Main.cpp:
tParse(argc, argv);
```

The unit tests, while not offering full coverage, show examples of this.


### Building

The suggested build methods are to eitehr use VSCode with the CMake Tools extension or from the command line. Both methods work in either Windows or Linux. There are two build-types (AKA configurations) with Tacent: Debug and Release. If you want to build debug versions pass -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug to the cmake command.

The 'install' target creates a directory called 'Install' that has all the built libraries (.a or .lib), exported headers, cmake target files, and the unit test executable.

#### Windows
* Install Visual Studio Community 2019 (this gives you CMake, Ninja, and the MSVC compiler)
* Install VS Code (optional)
* Open 64bit Command Prompt for VS2019 and cd into the the 'tacent' directory. Do an out-of-source build.
```
mkdir buildninja
cd buildninja
cmake .. -GNinja
ninja install
```    

#### Ubuntu
* Install ninja and either Clang or GCC
* Install VS Code from the snap store (optional)
```
sudo apt-get install ninja-build
```
* Open a terminal window and cd into the tacent directory.
```
mkdir buildninja
cd buildninja
cmake .. -GNinja
ninja install
```

#### Visual Studio Code
Using the VS Code editor along with the CMake Tools extension works surprisingly well. The editor is cross platform so you get the same experience on Ubuntu as well as Windows.

On either platform open up VSCode. Choose File->Open Folder and open the 'tacent' directory. It will automatically detect the CMakeFiles.txt files, suggest installing CMake Tools, ask permission to generate an intellisence database for code completion, etc.

On Windows choose the 'Visual Studio 2019 Release -amd64' compiler kit (on the bottom info bar). The build-type to the left can be set to either Debug or Release (tacent ships with a cmake-variants.yaml file since that's one thing CMake Tools doesn't read from CMake). To the right select 'install' for the build type. Hit F7.

The instructions for Ubuntu are nearly identical. The kit can be Clang 9 or 10 or GCC 9.3.
