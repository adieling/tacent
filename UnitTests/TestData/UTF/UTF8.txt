wΔ𝒞
I refuse to prove that I exist for proof denies faith and without faith I am nothing.
Ah, but the Babel fish proves you exist, therefore you don't.
And here are some Unicode characters: wΔ𝒞 (the third should look similar to a C)
w is ASCII, Δ is in the Basic Multilingual Plane, and 𝒞 is in an Astral plane.
