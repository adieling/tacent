 * Use the most accurate DCT/IDCT algorithm available in the underlying codec.
 * The default if this flag is not specified is implementation-specific.  For
 * example, the implementation of TurboJPEG for libjpeg[-turbo] uses the fast
 * algorithm by default when compressing, because this has been shown to have
 * only a very slight effect on accuracy, but it uses the accurate algorithm
 * when decompressing, because this has been shown to have a larger effect.
