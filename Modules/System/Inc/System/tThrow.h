// The tThrow header should not depend on any header that may need to throw an exception. This is why we can't inline
// the tError member functions. They would depend on tPrint which includes tFile, but tFile throws and needs tThrow.
// The same header included twice in the include chain doesn't work.
#include <Foundation/tString.h>


// All errors that can be thrown by any library module are derived from this. By catching exceptions of the tError
// type all possibilities can be covered. Conversely, derived classes can be caught for more control over who
// handles what type of error.
