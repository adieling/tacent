 * Chrominance subsampling options.
 * When pixels are converted from RGB to YCbCr (see #TJCS_YCbCr) or from CMYK
 * to YCCK (see #TJCS_YCCK) as part of the JPEG compression process, some of
 * the Cb and Cr (chrominance) components can be discarded or averaged together
 * to produce a smaller image with little perceptible loss of image clarity
 * (the human eye is more sensitive to small changes in brightness than to
 * small changes in color.)  This is called &quot;chrominance subsampling&quot;.
