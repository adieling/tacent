 * @~English
 * @brief Enumerators for specifying the transcode target format.
 *
 * For BasisU/ETC1S format, @e Opaque and @e alpha here refer to 2 separate
 * RGB images, a.k.a slices within the BasisU compressed data. For UASTC
 * format they refer to the RGB and the alpha components of the UASTC data. If
 * the original image had only 2 components, R will be in the opaque portion
 * and G in the alpha portion. The R value will be replicated in the RGB
 * components. In the case of BasisU the G value will be replicated in all 3
 * components of the alpha slice. If the original image had only 1 component
 * it&apos;s value is replicated in all 3 components of the opaque portion and
 * there is no alpha.
 *
 * @note You should not transcode sRGB encoded data to @c KTX_TTF_BC4_R,
 * @c KTX_TTF_BC5_RG, @c KTX_TTF_ETC2_EAC_R{,G}11, @c KTX_TTF_RGB565,
 * @c KTX_TTF_BGR565 or @c KTX_TTF_RGBA4444 formats as neither OpenGL nor
 * Vulkan support sRGB variants of these. Doing sRGB decoding in the shader
 * will not produce correct results if any texture filtering is being used.
