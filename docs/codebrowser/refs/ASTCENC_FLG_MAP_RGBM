 * @brief Enable RGBM map compression.
 *
 * Input data will be treated as HDR data that has been stored in an LDR RGBM-encoded wrapper
 * format. Data must be preprocessed by the user to be in LDR RGBM format before calling the
 * compression function, this flag is only used to control the use of RGBM-specific heuristics and
 * error metrics.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: The ASTC format is prone to bad failure modes with unconstrained RGBM data; very small
 * M values can round to zero due to quantization and result in black or white pixels. It is highly
 * recommended that the minimum value of M used in the encoding is kept above a lower threshold (try
 * 16 or 32). Applying this threshold reduces the number of very dark colors that can be
 * represented, but is still higher precision than 8-bit LDR.
 *
 * When this flag is set the value of @c rgbm_m_scale in the context must be set to the RGBM scale
 * factor used during reconstruction. This defaults to 5 when in RGBM mode.
 *
 * It is recommended that the value of @c cw_a_weight is set to twice the value of the multiplier
 * scale, ensuring that the M value is accurately encoded. This defaults to 10 when in RGBM mode,
 * matching the default scale factor.
