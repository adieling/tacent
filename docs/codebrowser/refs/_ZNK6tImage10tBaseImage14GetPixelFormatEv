<doc f='Modules/Image/Inc/Image/tBaseImage.h' l='93'>// Returns the current in-memory pixel format of this image object. Load paramters often modify it from the source
	// pixel format. For example, if you load a DDS and decide to decode, this format will return the decoded format,
	// often R8G8B8A8. If you decide not to decode, it will match the source format. Another example is loading a
	// RLE-compressed TGA, it also gets uncompressed to R8G8B8A8. Some tImage classes like tImagePNG support decodeing
	// to R16G16B16A16, and in the future some might support R32G32B32A32f for the decompressed/generic HDR format.</doc>
