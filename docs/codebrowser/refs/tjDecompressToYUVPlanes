 * Decompress a JPEG image into separate Y, U (Cb), and V (Cr) image
 * planes.  This function performs JPEG decompression but leaves out the color
 * conversion step, so a planar YUV image is generated instead of an RGB image.
 *
 * @param handle a handle to a TurboJPEG decompressor or transformer instance
 *
 * @param jpegBuf pointer to a buffer containing the JPEG image to decompress
 *
 * @param jpegSize size of the JPEG image (in bytes)
 *
 * @param dstPlanes an array of pointers to Y, U (Cb), and V (Cr) image planes
 * (or just a Y plane, if decompressing a grayscale image) that will receive
 * the YUV image.  These planes can be contiguous or non-contiguous in memory.
 * Use #tjPlaneSizeYUV() to determine the appropriate size for each plane based
 * on the scaled image width, scaled image height, strides, and level of
 * chrominance subsampling.  Refer to @ref YUVnotes &quot;YUV Image Format Notes&quot;
 * for more details.
 *
 * @param width desired width (in pixels) of the YUV image.  If this is
 * different than the width of the JPEG image being decompressed, then
 * TurboJPEG will use scaling in the JPEG decompressor to generate the largest
 * possible image that will fit within the desired width.  If &lt;tt&gt;width&lt;/tt&gt; is
 * set to 0, then only the height will be considered when determining the
 * scaled image size.  If the scaled width is not an even multiple of the MCU
 * block width (see #tjMCUWidth), then an intermediate buffer copy will be
 * performed within TurboJPEG.
 *
 * @param strides an array of integers, each specifying the number of bytes per
 * line in the corresponding plane of the output image.  Setting the stride for
 * any plane to 0 is the same as setting it to the scaled plane width (see
 * @ref YUVnotes &quot;YUV Image Format Notes&quot;.)  If &lt;tt&gt;strides&lt;/tt&gt; is NULL, then
 * the strides for all planes will be set to their respective scaled plane
 * widths.  You can adjust the strides in order to add an arbitrary amount of
 * line padding to each plane or to decompress the JPEG image into a subregion
 * of a larger YUV planar image.
 *
 * @param height desired height (in pixels) of the YUV image.  If this is
 * different than the height of the JPEG image being decompressed, then
 * TurboJPEG will use scaling in the JPEG decompressor to generate the largest
 * possible image that will fit within the desired height.  If &lt;tt&gt;height&lt;/tt&gt;
 * is set to 0, then only the width will be considered when determining the
 * scaled image size.  If the scaled height is not an even multiple of the MCU
 * block height (see #tjMCUHeight), then an intermediate buffer copy will be
 * performed within TurboJPEG.
 *
 * @param flags the bitwise OR of one or more of the @ref TJFLAG_ACCURATEDCT
 * &quot;flags&quot;
 *
 * @return 0 if successful, or -1 if an error occurred (see #tjGetErrorStr2()
 * and #tjGetErrorCode().)
